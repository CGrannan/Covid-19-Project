## Introduction

This project is designed to track covid-19 infections, hospitalizations, death rates and vacine deployment throughout the world. The dataset comes from Our World in Data. Each row in the dataset reflects any updates in a specific country for one day. There are 59 columns for the dataset that track infection and death statistics as well as population and infrastructure statistics for each country. For a deep look at what the dataset entails, check out OWiD's github [repository](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data). The readme does a really nice job of outlining what information is present, how it was collected, and any changes that have been made.

Currently the project is in early stages and this readme will be updated as the project progresses.
